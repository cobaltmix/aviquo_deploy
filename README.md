Here is the source code of our extracurricular finder. It currently uses no more advanced features than a database lookup, but we will definitely be incorporating some type of neural network in the near future. 

The source is open, but the database is not, for legal reasons. You can add your own scholarship data by running the code.

```bash
go run main.go
```

and 

```bash
go build main.go && ./main
```

for those new to go. Pretty self explanatory :)
